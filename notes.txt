This is a bunch of notes and insights I'm gathering as I read this book.

- Exercise 2:
I noticed a typo here: #Anything after the # is ignored by python. I should
have had a space between the hash and the 'A'

- Exercise 0:
Where he talks about weaning off videos and being able to gain information by
reading. I am assuming both code, books and documentation. This is where I want
to be with my skill level. I have already placed an embargo on video tutorials
and will focus solely on books and documentation.

I'm curious to learn about scope in Python. Variables are declared on the fly
without keywords so far. Curious.

The triple quote string escapes newlines and quotes inside of it. Cool to know.

#### I have to be sure to do this exercise tonight after my beers. Lol. -
  {{{Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. It's alright if you
  do not understand those; just read through and take notes about interesting
  things.}}}

  {{{Combine raw_input with argv to make a script that gets more input from a
  user. Don't over think it. Just use argv to get something, and raw_input to
  get something else from the user.}}}

  ##Notice how I'm keeping lines less than 80 characters like a good Python cha
  p... ;-)
