This is a bunch of notes and insights I'm gathering as I read this book.

I noticed a typo here: #Anything after the # is ignored by python. I should have had a space between the hash and the 'A'

- Exercise 0:
Where he talks about weaning off videos and being able to gain information by reading. I am assuming both code, books and documentation. This is where I want to be with my skill level. I have already placed an embargo on video tutorials and will focus solely on books and documentation.

The triple quote string escapes newlines and quotes inside of it. Cool to know.
