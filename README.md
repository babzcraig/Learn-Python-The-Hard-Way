# Learn-Python-The-Hard-Way
Learning Python with Zed Shaw's book - Learn Python The Hard Way. The plan is to commit at least one exercise to this repo everyday. With 52 exercises in all, I should be finished in less than 2 months. I'm hoping to make it in time for Christmas, 2016!! I'm already proficient with JavaScript and want to learn Python (the hard way) as my second language before moving on the C++. I'll be doing the exercises in my downtime after work as I feel the 'beginner' nature of the book will make it suited to relaxing in the evenings. :-)
